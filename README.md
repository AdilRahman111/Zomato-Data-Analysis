The Zomato data analysis examines restaurant performance based on customer engagement, pricing, service options, and restaurant type. The dataset includes details such as online ordering availability, table booking, customer ratings, votes, approximate cost for two, and restaurant categories. The analysis shows that restaurants offering online ordering receive significantly higher customer votes, indicating a strong preference for digital convenience. Mid-range restaurants, particularly those priced around ₹300–₹400 for two people, attract the highest engagement, while very low- and high-cost ranges are less preferred. In terms of restaurant type, dining restaurants and cafés receive the most customer attention compared to buffets and other formats. Overall, the study concludes that customer popularity on Zomato is strongly influenced by online ordering availability, affordable mid-range pricing, and dining-oriented restaurant formats.
